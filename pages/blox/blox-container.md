Blox Container
==============

The Blox Container is where you will attach all the Blox Definitions that should run on a GameObject. 

The component can be added via menu: `Component > Blox > Blox Visual Script`.

There are two parts to the container. The 1st is a list of all the attached Blox definitions and below that you will see a list of properties for the currently selected Blox.

This list of properties (Blox Variables) are defined in the Blox editor and the values changed here to be unique among Blox attached to various objects.
