BGS Settings
============

This area allows you to configure options related to the [Blox Game Systems](blox-bgs) that does not belong under other sections.

**Auto-load Bootstrap** can be turned off if you do not use the Blox Game Systems and do not want the BGS bootstrap to load when you press play. If you do use BGS then this must be on else the BGS systems will not function correctly during play testing.
