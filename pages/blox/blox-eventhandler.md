Event Handlers
==============

During runtime Blox will attach event handler components to GameObject which has Blox on them - added via [BloxContainer](blox-container.html).

The handlers will accept the Unity and other events and trigger the Blox Events to run.

You should never manually attach any of these to a GameObject and they will not be visible in the Component menu.
