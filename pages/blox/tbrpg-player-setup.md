Player Setup
============

The Default Party will be loaded when play testing a scene so you need to add at least one [character template](tbpg-char-templates.html) to have a playable character in the scene while testing.

Settings
--------

- Click Move Mask: Which layers the player can click on when trying to move the party or a character.
- Click Ray Length: How far the ray should be cast when checking what the player clicked on. Increase this if your camera can zoom out further.
