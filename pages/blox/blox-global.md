Blox Global
===========

The `BloxGlobal` prefab can be found under `Assets\projectData\Blox`

It is instantiated at runtime and exist throughout the game sesssion. It has two important components which you should not remove.

The `BloxGlobal` component is used by the Blox runtime while the `GlobalVariables` component allows you to add/ edit variables which will be available as Global Variables during runtime. These variables can be accessed (read/ set) via the `Common > Variable` Block.

See the [Variables](blox-variables.html) section for more information on Variables.
