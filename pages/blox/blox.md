Blox is a Visual Scripting solution which helps you to add behaviour to objects via a drag-and-drop interface with interconnecting Blocks (actions) that responds on Events.

Coders will feel right at home with something which flow similar to how code works rather than linked-nodes. Even non-coders can use it without the hassle of programming syntaxes and rules.

Blox also includes various systems commonly needed in games, like handling how the game starts up, auto loading scenes, showing splash screens, handling the UI screens and windows, and saving/ loading a player session. Additional systems mnight be provided via plugins.

- Event based system
