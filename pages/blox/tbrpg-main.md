TBRPGMain
=========

This component must be in all game scenes/ levels which your player party will explore. The Main Controller will make sure that the party is spawned in the correct spot in the scene and setup and manage various other things which are specific to the scene. 

A GameObject named `[TBRPG]` can be added to the game map/ level scene via menu: `GameObject > Turn Based RPG > Main Controller`.
