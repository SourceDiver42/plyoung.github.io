Character Prefabs
=================

This section is to define character prefabs. These prefabs can then be selected and used when setting up Character Templates.

Click on [+] or "Add new group" from the drop-down to create a new Group. You can then click the [+] button again to add a new prefab to this group. 

Each character prefab definition must be given a unique name. You can drag-an-drop an actual Prefab into the second field of the definition.
