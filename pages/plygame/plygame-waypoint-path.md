Waypoint Path 
=====================

![](/img/plygame/path/01.png)

The waypoint path is a simple system that can be used by other systems, like the NPC Controller. It is basically a list of linked nodes or path points.

The path can be added to a scene from the plyGame toolbar or menu: `GameObject > Create Other > Waypoint Path`.

The **Add Waypoint** button can be used to add more points and you can then click on a point's button in the inspector or on the screen block of a point in the scene to select it so that you may move it around. The green lines and arrow between the green blocks indicates how they are connected. A selected point is indicated by a red block in the scene.
