Location Marker 
=======================

![](/img/plygame/locmarker/00.png)

The Location Marker is a general purpose marker object. Its most common use would be to retrieve the position via Block and then use it when you want to instantiate something at the same spot.

It can be created from the menu: `GameObject > Create Other > Location Marker`, or the plyGame toolbar.
