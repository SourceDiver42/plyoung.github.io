Actors List
===================

![](/img/plygame/actor/01.png)
[Actors](actor.html) are the [player](player.html) and [non-player characters](npc.html) used in the game. Actors are created by adding components to a GameObject/ Prefab. See the relevent topics to learn more about creating character. This page is about the Actor tab in the plyGame Editor window which allows you to view all the Actors that are defined (as prefabs, not scene objects).
 

Editor Window
-------------

Only Prefabs will be collected and you can view all detected actors in the plyGame Editor Window under the Actors tab. The **Refresh** button can be used to force a refresh of the list if it seems like one of your actors where not found. Remember, scene objects can't be actors that appears in this list (even though they are still valid actors in the scene).

This Editor panel might contain other options in its menu depending on systems that makes use of Actors and want to add their configuration options on this panel.
