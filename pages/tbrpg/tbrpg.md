**WARNING: This plugin is still under heavy development. It is currently in Alpha state. Please visit the [Support Forum](http://forum.plyoung.com/t/turn-based-rpg-dev/3679) to track development and progress of this plugin.**

The Turn Based RPG plugin for [Blox](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/?asac=MnslCi8JXB#!/content/62473) adds various game systems and controllers which are commonly needed while developing RPG games with a tactical turn-based combat system. The plugin provide systems for game mechanics similar to games like Wasteland 2 or Divinity: Original Sin; not turn based games with a battle screen mechanic like the older Final Fantasy games or RPG Maker type games.

This is not a complete game or an API or Framework. It is a tool to develop a very genre specific game with. Please do not assume anything about this plugin. Ask if it is not discussed here or in the documentation/ videos. Do not purchase this plugin with the intent to create games which are not supported - I will not accept feature requests outside the scope of this plugin.
