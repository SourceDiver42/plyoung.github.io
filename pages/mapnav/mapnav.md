MapNav 2
========

[MapNav 2][1] will help you get started with a game where you need a tile or node based grid. This is useful for strategy games and board games.

It has various functions you will need when working with a grid map in these types of games; like getting the neighbouring tiles, or finding a path from one tile to another.

Have a look at [Battlemass 2][2], a game that were build with a basic version of this kit. You can also grab the [PDF Documentation][4] to learn more about the features available in the kit and API.
